I am deeply grateful for the support and guidance of many people. Foremost, I would like to thank Dr.~Terry Haut, my external advisor from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, for his knowledge, mentorship, and infectious enthusiasm for all things math. I would not be the confident mathematician I am today without our many discussions over the past four years. 
I would also like to thank the members of the ``VEF Biweekly Meeting'': Professor Dmitriy Anistratov (North Carolina State University) and Drs.~Terry Haut, Ben Yee (LLNL), Ben Southworth (LANL), and James Warsa (LANL) who helped sustain more than two years of productive and insightful meetings and served as the sounding board for many of the ideas presented here. In particular, I want to thank Professor Anistratov for his immense experience with the topics discussed in this dissertation and his encyclopedic ability to always know a reference to a related idea in the literature. 
The LDRD code team at LLNL consisting of Drs.~Terry Haut, Ben Yee, and Milan Holec made implementing these ideas as painless as possible. 
I am grateful to Professor Jim Morel (Texas A\&M University) for conceptualizing this fruitful and engaging topic and for guiding the earliest stages of this project and my professional development. 
I am very fortunate to have been supported by a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship, which enabled the flexibility and autonomy that allowed me to collaborate so widely.
