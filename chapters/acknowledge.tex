I am deeply grateful for the support and guidance of many people. 
Foremost, I would like to thank Dr.~Terry Haut, my external advisor from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, for his knowledge, mentorship, endless encouragement, and infectious enthusiasm for all things math. I would not be the confident mathematician I am today without our many discussions over the past four years. By his example, I learned to value and enjoy collaboration. 

I would also like to thank the members of the ``VEF Biweekly Meeting'', Professor Dmitriy Anistratov (North Carolina State University) and Drs.~Terry Haut, Ben Yee (LLNL), Ben Southworth (LANL), and James Warsa (LANL), who helped sustain three years of the productive and insightful meetings that served as the sounding board for many of the ideas presented here. In particular, I want to thank Professor Anistratov for his immense experience with the topics discussed in this dissertation and his encyclopedic ability to always know a reference to a related idea in the literature. 

I am grateful to the ``LDRD code team'' at LLNL consisting of Drs.~Terry Haut, Ben Yee, and Milan Holec, for welcoming me into their productive research environment. Their efforts, with Ben Yee in particular, expanded the reach, impact, and quality of my work. I would also like to thank LLNL for their generous computing allowance and the MFEM team for providing the foundation that allowed me to implement these ideas in a relatively painless manner at an impressive scale. 

The work in this dissertation began as an undergraduate research project conceptualized and guided by Professor Jim Morel at Texas A\&M University. I am truly grateful for Jim's expertise and guidance in the earliest stages of my professional development and for identifying the fruitful and engaging research ideas that culminated in this dissertation. 
Jim also brought the second moment method to my attention in my final year of graduate school, which I consider to be the most exciting and promising outcome of my work. 

I am very fortunate to have been supported by a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship. This fellowship enabled the freedom and autonomy that allowed me to collaborate so broadly. I am also thankful for the Applied Science \& Technology program at UC Berkeley which allowed me to pursue a truly interdisciplinary and unique degree.
