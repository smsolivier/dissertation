\section{The Boltzmann Transport Equation}
A discussion of the Boltzmann transport equation must begin with the definition of the particle distribution function, $f$. 
The set of all possible positions $\x$ and velocities $\v$ is called the system's phase space. The particle distribution function represents the expected number of particles at each point in the phase space. In other words, $f(\x,\v,t) \ud \x \ud \v = $ the expected number of particles in the differential phase space volume at a time $t$. 

The Boltzmann transport equation describes the evolution of the particle distribution function over time. In general, the Boltzmann equation is written as 
	\begin{equation}
		\dderiv{f}{t} = \paren{\pderiv{f}{t}}_\text{force} + \paren{\pderiv{f}{t}}_\text{collision} \,,
	\end{equation}
where the force and collision terms are application-dependent sources or sinks for the particle distribution function. The force term represents the effect of an external influence (i.e.~not caused by the particles themselves) and the collision term represents the effect of particles colliding with each other or a background material. If a force $\F$ acts on the particles over a time period of $\ud t$, the particles' position and velocity will change by an amount $\ud \x = \v\ud t$ and $\ud \v = \frac{\F}{m} \ud t$ where $m$ is the mass of the particle. Taking the total derivative of $f$ in the phase space: 
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\ud f &= \pderiv{f}{t} \ud t + \nabla f \cdot\ud \x + \nabla_{\v} f \cdot\ud \v \\
		&= \pderiv{f}{t} \ud t + \nabla f \cdot\v \ud t + \nabla_{\v}\cdot\frac{\F}{m} \ud t \,, 
	\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
where $\nabla_{\v} = \pderiv{}{v_x} \e_x + \pderiv{}{v_y}\e_y + \pderiv{}{v_z} \e_z$ denotes the gradient in velocity space. 
Dividing by $\ud t$ yields: 
	\begin{equation}
		\dderiv{f}{t} = \pderiv{f}{t} + \v \cdot \nabla f + \frac{\F}{m} \cdot \nabla_{\v} f \,. 
	\end{equation}
Thus, the force term $\paren{\pderiv{f}{t}}_\text{force} = \frac{\F}{m}\cdot\nabla_{\v} f$ so that the general form of the Boltzmann equation can be equivalently be written: 
	\begin{equation}
		\pderiv{f}{t} + \v \cdot \nabla f + \frac{\F}{m} \cdot \nabla_{\v} f = \paren{\pderiv{f}{t}}_\text{collision} \,. 
	\end{equation}
For charged particle transport, the particles experience external electromagnetic forces and frequently interact with each other through Coloumb collisions. In this case, particles with charge $q$ experience the force $\F = q(\E + \v\times \mat{B})$ due to the electric field, $\E$, and magnetic field, $\mat{B}$. The Coloumbic collision term is described by the (quite complicated) Fokker-Planck operator. 

Here, we focus on neutral particle transport (i.e.~photons or neutrons). Since these particles do not have charge, there are no external electromagnetic forces. Furthermore, particle-particle collisions are exceedingly rare and it is thus commonplace to ignore them. The collision term then only includes the interaction of the neutral particle with the background medium. These interactions are broadly classified into absorption and scattering events. The probabilities of these events occuring per unit distance traveled are called cross sections for neutrons and opacities for photons and are govenered by nuclear physics. The most general form of the Boltzmann transport equation for a neutral particle is then: 
	\begin{equation}
		\pderiv{f}{t} + \v \cdot \nabla f = \paren{\pderiv{f}{t}}_\text{absorption} + \paren{\pderiv{f}{t}}_\text{scattering} + \paren{\pderiv{f}{t}}_\text{source} \,,
	\end{equation}
where we have split the collision term into absorption and scattering terms and included an additional term representing an external source of particles. For neutrons, the external source could be a fixed-source of particles such as radioactive material that emits neutrons. For photons, we consider the source to be the thermal emission of photons. Thus, the photon external source is dependent on the material's temperature. We note that the case of the general Boltzmann equation under the assumption that particles do not interact with each other is called the linear Boltzmann equation. 

\section{Navigating Notation: $f$, $\psi$, and $I$}
Application of the Boltzmann transport equation to modeling radiation is home to three sets of notation: nuclear engineering, astrophysics, and \gls{hedp}. The hope of this section is to provide the means for newcomers of this subject to navigate these three fields. In all cases, the velocity variable is represented using a direction-of-flight variable, $\Omegahat$, and an energy variable. 
The angular variable, $\Omegahat$, is represented using the spherical coordinate system depicted in Fig.~\ref{trans:omega_diagram} which uses a polar and azimuthal angle to describe the direction $\Omegahat$ in three-dimensional space.

\label{trans:omega_diagram}
\end{figure}
In the case of neutrons, the energy variable is $E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ where $v = |\v|$ is the speed of the particle. For photons, $E = h\nu$ with $h$ Planck's constant and $\nu$ the photon frequency. Since $h$ is a constant, the photon distribution is usually presented as a function of frequency. Thus, we say that $f(\x,\v,t) = f(\x,\Omegahat,E,t) = f(\x,\Omegahat,\nu,t)$. Note that even though $\Omegahat$ is a three-dimensional vector, it is represented only using two parameters. In other words, $f(\x,\Omegahat,E,t)$ and $f(\x,\Omegahat,\nu,t)$ are both still functions of seven independent variables. 

For nuclear reactors, neutrons are the primary particle of interest and the goal is to understand the fission power produced by the system. To that end, the transport equation is cast in terms of the \emph{angular flux}, $\psi$. The angular flux represents the particle path length density in the phase space. In other words, $\psi \ud \x \ud \Omega \ud E \ud t$ represents the expected distance traveled by particles located in the phase space element $\ud \x \ud \Omega\ud E$ in the time interval $\ud t$. In relation to the distribution function, $f$, the angular flux is defined as the product of the particle speed and the distribution function: 
	\begin{equation}
		\psi(\x,\Omegahat,E,t) = v f(\x,\Omegahat,E,t) \,. 
	\end{equation}
This definition is the natural choice for computing reaction rates. If $\sigma$ represents the probability of a neutron inducing a reaction per unit length traveled, $\sigma \psi \ud \x \ud \Omega\ud E \ud t$ represents the expected number of reactions induced by neutrons traveling in the phase space element $\ud\x\ud\Omega\ud E$ in the time $\ud t$. The reaction rate is computed by integrating $\sigma \psi$ over the domain of the reaction, $\D$, all angles on the unit sphere, $\mathbb{S}^2$, and all energies $E \in [0,\infty)$. Thus, the number of reactions per unit time is computed as 
	\begin{equation}
		\int_\D \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \int_0^\infty \sigma \psi \ud E \ud \Omega \ud \x \,. 
	\end{equation}

Radiation transport in astrophysics and \gls{hedp} is often concerned with the energy transfer and deposition associated with thermal photons. The Boltzmann equation is then typically cast in terms of the \emph{intensity}, $I$, which represents the expected amount of energy associated with photons traveling within a differential phase space volume. The intensity is defined as 
	\begin{equation}
		I(\x,\Omegahat,\nu,t) = c h \nu f(\x,\Omegahat,\nu,t) \,,
	\end{equation}
where $c$ is the speed of light. Since photons travel at the speed of light, the particle speed $v = c$. Thus, the intensity and angular flux are related through 
	\begin{equation}
		I(\x,\Omegahat,\nu,t) = h\nu \psi(\x,\Omegahat,E,t) \,. 
	\end{equation}
If $\sigma_a$ represents the probability per unit length of a material absorbing a photon, the total energy deposited in the material is computed with 
	\begin{equation}
		\int_\D \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \int_0^\infty \sigma_a I \ud \nu \ud\Omega \ud \x \,. 
	\end{equation}
Since a photon's energy is related to its momentum, $p$, through $E = p c$, a photon traveling in direction $\Omegahat$ has momentum $\vec{p} = \Omegahat \frac{E}{c}$. Thus, the momentum associated with photons traveling in a phase volume is $\frac{1}{c}\Omegahat I \ud \x \ud\Omega \ud \nu$. 
The momentum deposition from photons being absorbed by a material is then: 
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{1}{c}\int_\D \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \int_0^\infty \sigma_a\,\Omegahat I \ud \nu \ud \Omega\ud \x \,. 
	\end{equation}
