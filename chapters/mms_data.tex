\caption{Error values for the VEF method on an isotropic MMS test problem. The H1, RT, and HRT columns refer to the $Y_p\times W_{p+1}$, $Y_p\times \RT_p$, and hybridized $Y_p\times \RT_p$ discretizations, respectively. The error in the scalar flux, the error in the scalar flux when the exact solution is first projected onto $Y_p$, and the error in the current are presented for each method over a range of values of $p$. Here, the VEF data are constant in space and thus are represented exactly. }

The error in the scalar flux, the error in the scalar flux when the exact solution is first projected onto $Y_p$, and the error in the current are presented for each method over a range of values of $p$. Here, the angular flux used to calculate the VEF data is represented with $Y_p$. Due to this, the maximum accuracy expected is order $p+1$. }
