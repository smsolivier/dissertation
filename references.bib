abstract = "We present a new flux-fixup approach for arbitrarily high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of the SN transport equation, and we demonstrate the compatibility of this approach with the Variable Eddington Factor (VEF) method [1], [2]. The new fixup approach is sweep-compatible: during a transport sweep (block Gauss-Seidel iteration in which the scattering source is lagged), a local quadratic programming (QP) problem is solved in each spatial element to ensure that the solution satisfies certain physical constraints, including local particle balance. In this paper, we describe two choices of physical constraints, resulting in two variants of the method: QP Zero (QPZ) and QP Maximum Principle (QPMP). In QPZ, the finite element coefficients of the solution are constrained to be nonnegative. In QPMP, they are constrained to adhere to an approximate discrete maximum principle. There are two primary takeaways in this paper. First, when the positive Bernstein basis is used for DG discretization, the QPMP method eliminates negativities, preserves high-order accuracy for smooth problems, and significantly dampens unphysical oscillations in the solution. The latter feature – the dampening of unphysical oscillations – is an improvement upon standard, simpler fixup approaches such as the approach described in [3] (denoted as the “zero and rescale” (ZR) method in this paper). This improvement comes at a moderate computational cost, but it is not prohibitive. Our results show that, even in an unrealistic worst-case scenario where 83% of the spatial elements require a fixup, the computational cost of performing a transport sweep with fixup is only ∼31% greater than performing one without fixup. The second takeaway is that the VEF method can be used to accelerate the convergence of transport sweeps even when a fixup is applied. When optically thick regions are present, transport sweeps converge slowly, regardless of whether a fixup is applied, and acceleration is needed. However, attempting to apply standard diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA) to fixed-up transport sweeps results in divergence for optically thick problems. Our results show that the same is not true for VEF. When VEF is combined with fixed-up transport sweeps, the result is a scheme that produces a nonnegative solution, converges independently of the mean free path, and, in the case of the QPMP fixup, adheres to an approximate discrete maximum principle."

abstract = {In this paper we analyze a multilevel quasidiffusion (QD) method for solving time-dependent multigroup nonlinear radiative transfer problems which describe interaction of photons with matter. The multilevel method is formulated by means of the high-order radiative transfer equation and a set of low-order moment equations. The fully implicit scheme is used to discretize equations in time. The stability analysis is applied to the method in semi-continuous and discretized forms. To perform Fourier analysis, the system of equations of the multilevel method is linearized about an equilibrium solution. The effects of discretization with respect to different independent variables are studied. The multilevel method is shown to be stable and fast converging. We also consider a version of the method in which time evolution in the radiative transfer equation is treated by means of the α-approximation. The Fleck–Cummings test problem is used to demonstrate performance of the multilevel QD method and study its iterative stability.}

abstract = {We study the convergence of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method applied to the advection–reaction equation on meshes with reentrant faces. On such meshes, the upwind numerical flux is not smooth, and so the numerical integration of the resulting face terms can only be expected to be first-order accurate. Despite this inexact integration, we prove that the DG method converges with order O(hp+1/2), which is the same rate as in the case of exact integration. Consequently, specialized quadrature rules that accurately integrate the non-smooth numerical fluxes are not required for high-order accuracy. These results are numerically corroborated on examples of linear advection and discrete ordinates transport equations.}

abstract = {Positive spatial difference schemes for the Boltzmann equation are derived and compared in x -y geometry. It is found that none of the positive schemes are as accurate as the most commonly used nonpositive scheme. A variable weighted difference scheme in which the weights are chosen depending on the space-angle mesh is shown to give results similar to those obtained with difference schemes based on the method of characteristics. A version of the variable weight scheme in which weights depend not only on the space-angle mesh but also on particle sources and fluxes is suggested as a means of obtaining the highest accuracy consistent with a positive difference scheme, but it is noted that such schemes are computationally more expensive than available corrective recipes used in conjunction with nonpositive schemes.}

abstract={Obtaining a burning plasma is a critical step towards self-sustaining fusion energy1. A burning plasma is one in which the fusion reactions themselves are the primary source of heating in the plasma, which is necessary to sustain and propagate the burn, enabling high energy gain. After decades of fusion research, here we achieve a burning-plasma state in the laboratory. These experiments were conducted at the US National Ignition Facility, a laser facility delivering up to 1.9{\thinspace}megajoules of energy in pulses with peak powers up to 500{\thinspace}terawatts. We use the lasers to generate X-rays in a radiation cavity to indirectly drive a fuel-containing capsule via the X-ray ablation pressure, which results in the implosion process compressing and heating the fuel via mechanical work. The burning-plasma state was created using a strategy to increase the spatial scale of the capsule2,3 through two different implosion concepts4--7. These experiments show fusion self-heating in excess of the mechanical work injected into the implosions, satisfying several burning-plasma metrics3,8. Additionally, we describe a subset of experiments that appear to have crossed the static self-heating boundary, where fusion heating surpasses the energy losses from radiation and conduction. These results provide an opportunity to study $\alpha$-particle-dominated plasmas and burning-plasma physics in the laboratory.},
