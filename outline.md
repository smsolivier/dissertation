# Introduction
* motivation 
	* HO on HO 
* pare down to simple linear transport problem 
* gap in VEF literature 

# VEF Background
* transport equation introduction 
* derivation of VEF 
	* miften larsen BCs 
* operator notation derivation of VEF algorithm
	* fixed point 
	* anderson 
* properties of VEF data 
	* gateaux derivative -> nullspace 

# FEM 
* description of mesh 
* notation 
* integration transforms 
* finite element spaces 
* assembly 

# Transport Discretizations
* SN 
* DG 
	* upwind discretization 
	* lagging on curved meshes 
	* flux fixup
* could be place to show full matrix, idea of richardson? 

# DGVEF 

# RTVEF 

# SMM

# Conclusions
* comparison of methods 
* summary of results 
* future work
